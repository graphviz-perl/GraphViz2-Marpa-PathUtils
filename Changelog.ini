Comments= <<EOT
- Add another demo, graphs/directed/arrows.gv as data/08.clusters.in.gv, from Graphviz V 2.29.
- Remove the special-case label "\N" from data/02.fixed.paths.in.gv. Such an escape sequence causes
Graphviz to override the node-renumbering logic in find_fixed_length_paths(), which I need to allow
the same node to appear multiple times in the output graph without Graphviz automatically coalescing
them into a single node.
- Add a new FAQ entry (the first in the list) to discuss this issue.
- Remove some other, redundant, node attributes from data/02.fixed.paths.in.gv, to simplify debugging all this.
