Comments= <<EOT
- Install Graphviz 2.30.1 from AT&T.
- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.
- Re-write the code in Build.PL and Makefile.PL which checks for Graphviz (dot) being installed,
since the previous code, using a pipe, was failing on some versions of Windows.
- Assume Config.pm is installed, and hence remove it from the pre-reqs.
This also stops a warning message generated because Config's version # is undef.
- Likewise assume File::Spec and File::Temp are installed, and 'recent enough'.
This is because the new code uses these 3 modules before specifying the pre-reqs.
- Bump the pre-req for Perl from 5.10.0 to 5.14, since we 'use feature qw/unicode_strings/.
- Re-write the code in Build.PL and Makefile.PL which checks for Perl being 'recent enough',
since the previous code, using a pre-req of "perl => '5.10.0'" generates a warning message
when using Makefile.PL (for my current Perl V 5.14.2). Now we analyze $Config{version}.
- Re-create the demo files. See scripts/generate.demo.sh.

Comments= <<EOT
- Add another demo, graphs/directed/arrows.gv as data/08.clusters.in.gv, from Graphviz V 2.29.
- Remove the special-case label "\N" from data/02.fixed.paths.in.gv. Such an escape sequence causes
Graphviz to override the node-renumbering logic in find_fixed_length_paths(), which I need to allow
the same node to appear multiple times in the output graph without Graphviz automatically coalescing
them into a single node.
- Add a new FAQ entry (the first in the list) to discuss this issue.
- Remove some other, redundant, node attributes from data/02.fixed.paths.in.gv, to simplify debugging all this.

Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.
- Remove from TODO things which have been implemented.
- Add scripts/code.attributes2html.pl to create html/code.attributes.html.
- Add back data/07.clusters.in.gv now Graphviz bug is fixed in V 2.29.20121107.0545.
