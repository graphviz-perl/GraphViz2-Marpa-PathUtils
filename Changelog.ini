- Switch from Hash::FieldHash to Moo.
- Re-write to use GraphViz2::Marpa V 2.03. This involves many changes.
One effect is that the original structure and attributes of nodes and edges is now preserved
in the output clusters.
- Rename *::Utils to *::Demo. It's only used by the author.
Rewrite the html generating code, so each cluster test and each fixed length path test has
own web page.
- Update the docs.
- Edit line lengths in docs to be 100 chars, max.
- Rename data/*.gv files, and move output *.gv files into out/.
- With clusters, output each cluster into its own out/*.gv and html/*.svg file.
- Update MANIFEST.
- Update the pre-reqs.
- Replace Path::Class with File::Spec.
- Rename parameters to new().
- Add github repo to docs, Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
- Move t/pod.t to xt/author/.
- TODO: Things which are not yet implemented:
o Paths into or out of subgraphs.
o allow_cycle logic.

Comments= <<EOT
- After calling find_clusters(), sort the result twice: Once for elements within a set and once
for the sets, because Marpa::R2 V 2.079_013 returns results in a different order than
previous versions.

[V 1.04]
Date=2013-06-12T08:55:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Install Graphviz 2.30.1 from AT&T.
- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.
- Re-write the code in Build.PL and Makefile.PL which checks for Graphviz (dot) being installed,
since the previous code, using a pipe, was failing on some versions of Windows.
- Assume Config.pm is installed, and hence remove it from the pre-reqs.
This also stops a warning message generated because Config's version # is undef.
- Likewise assume File::Spec and File::Temp are installed, and 'recent enough'.
This is because the new code uses these 3 modules before specifying the pre-reqs.
- Bump the pre-req for Perl from 5.10.0 to 5.14, since we 'use feature qw/unicode_strings/.
- Re-write the code in Build.PL and Makefile.PL which checks for Perl being 'recent enough',
since the previous code, using a pre-req of "perl => '5.10.0'" generates a warning message
when using Makefile.PL (for my current Perl V 5.14.2). Now we analyze $Config{version}.
- Re-create the demo files. See scripts/generate.demo.sh.

[V 1.03]
Date=2013-05-20T11:38:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add another demo, graphs/directed/arrows.gv as data/08.clusters.in.gv, from Graphviz V 2.29.
- Remove the special-case label "\N" from data/02.fixed.paths.in.gv. Such an escape sequence
causes Graphviz to override the node-renumbering logic in find_fixed_length_paths(), which I
need to allow the same node to appear multiple times in the output graph without Graphviz
automatically coalescing them into a single node.
- Add a new FAQ entry (the first in the list) to discuss this issue.
- Remove some other, redundant, node attributes from data/02.fixed.paths.in.gv, to simplify
debugging all this.

[V 1.02]
Date=2012-11-08T12:38:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.
- Remove from TODO things which have been implemented.
- Add scripts/code.attributes2html.pl to create html/code.attributes.html.
- Add back data/07.clusters.in.gv now Graphviz bug is fixed in V 2.29.20121107.0545.

[V 1.01]
Date=2012-10-15T14:20:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Implement find_clusters() which finds mutually-exclusive clusters of nodes.
- Rename data/* and html/* demo files.
- Re-write scripts/generate.demo.pl to handle new code and file names.
- Put the demo generating code into GraphViz2::Marpa::PathUtils::Demo.
