Revision history for Perl extension GraphViz2::Marpa::PathUtils.

1.03  Mon May 20 11:38:00 2013
	- Add another demo, graphs/directed/arrows.gv as data/08.clusters.in.gv, from Graphviz V 2.29.
	- Remove the special-case label "\N" from data/02.fixed.paths.in.gv. Such an escape sequence causes
		Graphviz to override the node-renumbering logic in find_fixed_length_paths(), which I need to allow
		the same node to appear multiple times in the output graph without Graphviz automatically coalescing
		them into a single node.
	- Add a new FAQ entry (the first in the list) to discuss this issue.
	- Remove some other, redundant, node attributes from data/02.fixed.paths.in.gv, to simplify debugging all this.

1.02  Thu Nov  8 12:38:00 2012
	- No code changes.
	- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
		Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.
	- Remove from TODO things which have been implemented.
	- Add scripts/code.attributes2html.pl to create html/code.attributes.html.
	- Add back data/07.clusters.in.gv now Graphviz bug is fixed in V 2.29.20121107.0545.

1.01  Mon Oct 15 14:20:00 2012
	- Implement find_clusters() which finds mutually-exclusive clusters of nodes.
	- Rename data/* and html/* demo files.
	- Re-write scripts/generate.demo.pl to handle new code and file names.
	- Put the demo generating code into GraphViz2::Marpa::PathUtils::Demo.
